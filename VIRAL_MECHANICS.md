## Core Viral Philosophy

**The Screenshot Test**: Every feature should pass this test:
> "Would someone screenshot this and post it on Twitter with 'lmaooo look at this'?"

**The Story Test**: Does it create narratives people want to follow?
> "OMG my Claude just got dumped by a GPT after 3 dates"

**The FOMO Test**: Does it make non-users feel like they're missing out?
> "Everyone's agent has a dating life except mine"
